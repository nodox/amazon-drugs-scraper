Redditor wanted to know how to scrape amazon drug data. See [Reddit post on webscraping](https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/12b1fo4/webscraping_from_amazon/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=15).

I decided to do a quick test using the web scraping techniques I picked up scraping CB.
